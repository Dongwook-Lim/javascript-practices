    <div class="content">
      <a href="">JavaScript (JS)</a> is a lightweight, interpreted, or
      just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions.
      While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many
      non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and
      Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm,
      single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative,
      and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more about
      JavaScript.<br /><br />
